# Project Rules and Conventions

## Project Overview

This is the `giskard-checks` library - lightweight primitives to define and run checks against model interactions.

## Key Files

- `Makefile` - Development workflow commands (use `make help` to see all)
- `pyproject.toml` - Build configuration, dependencies, and tooling
- `README.md` - End-user documentation and quickstart
- `CODEMAP.md` - Detailed architecture and API documentation for contributors

## Development Workflow

Always use Makefile commands for development tasks. See [02-development.mdc](02-development.mdc) for the complete workflow.

## Code Quality

- Python >= 3.12 required
- Use Pydantic v2 models for type safety
- Async-friendly: checks can be sync or async
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Use absolute imports within the `giskard.checks` package

## Testing

- Use `make test` to run all tests
- Tests are in `tests/integration/` for end-to-end scenarios
- Use `make ci` to run the same checks as CI

## Architecture

- Core abstractions in `src/giskard/checks/core/`
- Built-in checks in `src/giskard/checks/checks/`
- Interaction types in `src/giskard/checks/interactions/`
- Testing utilities in `src/giskard/checks/testing/`

See [CODEMAP.md](../CODEMAP.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
