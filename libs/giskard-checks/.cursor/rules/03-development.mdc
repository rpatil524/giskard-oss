# Development Workflow

This project uses a Makefile for common development tasks. Always prefer using Makefile commands over direct tool invocations.

## Quick Start

```bash
make setup    # Complete development setup (install deps + tools)
make all      # Format, check, and test
```

## Common Commands

- `make help` - Show all available commands with descriptions
- `make setup` - Complete development setup (install deps + tools)
- `make install` - Install project dependencies
- `make install-tools` - Install development tools (ruff, vermin, pre-commit)
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make lint` - Run linting checks
- `make format` - Format code with ruff
- `make check-format` - Check if code is formatted correctly
- `make check-compat` - Check Python 3.12 compatibility
- `make check` - Run all checks (lint, format, compatibility)
- `make all` - Format, check, and test
- `make ci` - Run the same checks as CI
- `make clean` - Clean up build artifacts and caches

## Pre-commit

- `make pre-commit-install` - Setup pre-commit hooks
- `make pre-commit-run` - Run pre-commit on all files

## Guidelines

1. Always use `make` commands instead of direct `uv` or tool invocations
2. Run `make ci` before pushing to ensure CI will pass
3. Use `make all` for a complete development cycle (format, check, test)
4. Use `make setup` for initial project setup
5. Use `make clean` to clean up build artifacts when needed
